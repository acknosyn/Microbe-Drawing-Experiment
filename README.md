#Microbe Experiment
This is a project I created while I was learning Processing. The overall idea was to create an app for creatively drawing. I used a scientific theme for the drawing machine.

##Synthetic Microbes
The idea behind the creative drawing machine was to create an environment which allowed the user to artificially create Microbes. The user draws the shape of the Microbe, and it 'lives', acting as an autonomous agent moving on its own or following the user's cursor.

##Microbes Are Artists
The Microbe's leave a trail behind them (Toggable via the 'Trail' button) which creates interesting designs. The Microbe's trail attributes are calculated at the time the Microbe is created. This includes the width and colour. 

##Uniqueness
The design the trails make are also determined by the movement attributes of the Microbe. Each Microbe has a different max velocity and turning force. This makes the drawing they leave behind differ significantly with every new 'sample' of Microbe's.

#How To Draw
To use the app, click on the 'Create' button and draw a Microbe. You can draw anything, go nuts! Alternatively, you can just click 'Create' and then 'Done' without drawing anything to create an invisible Microbe. This is so you can just see the trails they leave without a big Microbe body in the way. Look at 'Example_3.png' for an example.
